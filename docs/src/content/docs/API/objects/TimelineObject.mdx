The return object when creating a new timeline.

### timelineInfo

`timelineInfo: TimelineInfo`

Retrieves information about the timeline.
Returns the same object that is passed to the update callback.

:::note
This object values will be updated on every frame update if the timeline is playing.
:::

See: [TimelineInfo](/animare/api/objects/timelineinfo/)

### animationsInfo

`animationsInfo: CallbackInfo`

Retrieves information about all animations.
Returns the same object that is passed to the the update callback.

:::note
This object values will be updated on every frame update if the timeline is playing.
:::

See: [AnimationInfo](/animare/api/objects/animationinfo/)

### play()

`(startFrom?: number | PercentageString, playCount?: number) => void`

Plays the timeline.
Accepts an optional `startFrom` parameter that can be a time in milliseconds or a percentage value.
Optionally, you can specify a `playCount` to seek to a specific repeat count.

`startFrom` The point to start from, specified as a time in milliseconds or a percentage value.<br/>
`playCount` The repeat count to seek to before playing.

```ts title="Play" frame="terminal"
timeline.play(); // Play from the start
timeline.play(500); // Play from 500 milliseconds
timeline.play('50%'); // Play from 50% of the timeline duration
timeline.play('50%', 2); // Play from 50% of the timeline duration on the second repeat
```

### playOneFrame()

`playOneFrame: () => void`

Plays only one frame of the timeline.
If the timeline is already playing, this method does nothing.

:::caution
This method will not trigger `play` events.
:::

```ts title="Play One Frame" frame="terminal"
timeline.seek('50%');
timeline.playOneFrame();
```

### pause()

`pause: () => void`

Pauses the timeline.
If the timeline is already paused, it remains paused.
If the timeline is not playing, it will not be paused.

### resume()

`resume: () => void`

Resumes the timeline from a paused state.
If the timeline is not paused, it will start playing from the beginning.
If the timeline is already playing, this method does nothing.

### stop()

`(stopAt?: number | PercentageString, playCount?: number) => void`

Stops the timeline from playing.
If no parameters are passed, the animation will skip to the end and stop.
You can pass parameters to stop at a specific point in the timeline.
If the timeline is not currently playing, it plays only one frame at the specified stop point.

`stopAt` The point to stop at, specified as a time in milliseconds or a percentage string. <br/>
`playCount` The repeat count to stop at.

```ts title="Stop" frame="terminal"
timeline.stop(); // Skip to the end and stop
timeline.stop('50%'); // Skip to 50% of the timeline and stop
```

### seek()

`(seekTo: number | PercentageString, playCount?: number) => void`

Seeks the timeline to a specified time or percentage value.
If the timeline is not playing, it will seek without playing.

`seekTo` The point to seek to, specified as a `time` in milliseconds or a percentage value. <br/>
`playCount` The repeat count to seek to before playing.

```ts title="Seek" frame="terminal"
timeline.seek(500); // Seek to 500 milliseconds
timeline.seek('50%'); // Seek to 50% of the timeline duration
timeline.seek('50%', 2); // Seek to 50% of the timeline duration on the second repeat
```

### updateValues()

`(newValues: AnimationOptions[]) => void` <Badge text="Throws" variant="danger" size="small" />

Updates animations values. <br/>
The `name` property is **required** to target a specific animation for updating.

:::caution
Updating the animation values while the timeline is playing might result in flickering.
:::

```ts title="Change animation values" frame="terminal"
timeline.updateValues([{ name: 'myAnimation', duration: 500 }]);
```

See: [AnimationOptions](/animare/api/objects/animationoptions/)

### on()

`on: (event: Event, callback: EventCallback) => EventUnsubscribe`

Attaches an event listener to the timeline.
returns A function to unsubscribe the event listener.

```ts title="Attach an event listener" frame="terminal"
const unsubscribe = on(Event.Play, () => {
  // do something
});

unsubscribe(); // To remove the event listener
```

See: [Event](/animare/api/enums/event/)

### once()

`once: (event: Event, callback: EventCallback) => EventUnsubscribe`

Attaches an event listener to the timeline that will be triggered only once.
returns A function to unsubscribe the event listener.

See: [Event](/animare/api/enums/event/)

### clearEvents()

`clearEvents: () => void`

Removes all attached event listeners.

### onCompleteAsync()

`onCompleteAsync: () => Promise<void>`

Waits until the timeline completes.

```ts
await timeline.onCompleteAsync();
```

### onPlayAsync()

`onPlayAsync: () => Promise<void>`

Waits until the timeline starts playing.

```ts
await timeline.onPlayAsync();
```

### onResumeAsync()

`onResumeAsync: () => Promise<void>`

Waits until the timeline resumes.

```ts
await timeline.onResumeAsync();
```

### onPauseAsync()

`onPauseAsync: () => Promise<void>`

Waits until the timeline pauses.

```ts
await timeline.onPauseAsync();
```

### onStopAsync()

`onStopAsync: () => Promise<void>`

Waits until the timeline stops.

```ts
await timeline.onStopAsync();
```

### onRepeatAsync()

`onRepeatAsync: () => Promise<void>`

Waits until the timeline repeats.

```ts
await timeline.onRepeatAsync();
```
