### name

`name: readonly string` <Badge text="Required" variant="note" size="small" />

The name of the animation, used to identify the animation in the timeline.

### to

`to: number` <Badge text="Required" variant="note" size="small" />

The ending value of the animation.

### from

`from?: number` <Badge text="Default: 0" variant="tip" size="small" />

The starting value of the animation.

### duration

`duration?: number | (index: number) => number` <Badge text="Default: 350" variant="tip" size="small" />

The duration of the animation in milliseconds.

### delay (offest)

`delay?: number | (index: number) => number` <Badge text="Default: 0" variant="tip" size="small" />

This property specifies the delay before the animation starts, in milliseconds, and can accept negative values.
It acts as an animation offset within the timeline, allowing you to delay the animation or make it start earlier by using negative values.

### playCount

`playCount?: number | (index: number) => number` <Badge text="Default: 1" variant="tip" size="small" />

The number of times the animation should play.
A value of `0` means this animation will be ignored.

### delayCount

`delayCount?: number | (index: number) => number` <Badge text="Default: playCount" variant="tip" size="small" />

The number of times the delay should be applied on each animation play.
For example, with `delayCount: 1` and `playCount: 4`, the delay will be applied only once on the first play.

:::caution
A value higher than `playCount` will be ignored.
:::

### direction

`direction?: Direction | (index: number) => Direction` <Badge text="Default: Direction.Forward" variant="tip" size="small" />

The direction in which the animation should play.

See: [Direction](/animare/api/enums/direction/)

### timing

`timing?: AnimationTiming | (index: number) => AnimationTiming` <Badge text="Default: AnimationTiming.AfterPrevious" variant="tip" size="small" />

The position of the animation in the timeline, determining when it should start relative to the timeline.

:::caution
First animation should always have `AnimationTiming.FromStart`
:::

See: [AnimationTiming](/animare/api/enums/animationtiming/)

### ease

`ease?: (t: number) => number` <Badge text="Default: ease.linear" variant="tip" size="small" />

The easing function for the animation, defining the rate of change of the animated value over time.

See: [Ease](/animare/api/plugins/ease/)
