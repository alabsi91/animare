The ending value of the animation.

### from

`from?: number` <Badge text="Default: 0" variant="tip" size="small" />

The starting value of the animation.

### duration

`duration?: number | (index: number) => number` <Badge text="Default: 350" variant="tip" size="small" />

The duration of the animation in milliseconds.

### offset

`offset?: number | (index: number) => number` <Badge text="Default: 0" variant="tip" size="small" />

Offsets the animation by a specific value in milliseconds.
a positive value will act like a delay, while a negative value will play the animation earlier.

### delay

`delay?: number | (index: number) => number` <Badge text="Default: 0" variant="tip" size="small" />

This property specifies the delay before the animation starts, in milliseconds.

### playCount

`playCount?: number | (index: number) => number` <Badge text="Default: 1" variant="tip" size="small" />

The number of times the animation should play.
A value of `0` means this animation will be ignored.

### delayCount

`delayCount?: number | (index: number) => number` <Badge text="Default: playCount" variant="tip" size="small" />

The number of times the delay should be applied on each animation play.
For example, with `delayCount: 1` and `playCount: 4`, the delay will be applied only once on the first play.

:::caution
A value higher than `playCount` will be ignored.

### direction

`direction?: Direction | (index: number) => Direction` <Badge text="Default: Direction.Forward" variant="tip" size="small" />

The direction in which the animation should play.

### timing

`timing?: Timing | (index: number) => Timing` <Badge text="Default: Timing.AfterPrevious" variant="tip" size="small" />

The position of the animation in the timeline, determining when it should start relative to the timeline.

:::caution
First animation should always have `Timing.FromStart`

### ease

`ease?: (t: number) => number` <Badge text="Default: ease.linear" variant="tip" size="small" />

The easing function for the animation, defining the rate of change of the animated value over time.
